Not-A-Number, or just NaN, is a property of JavaScript's *global object*. It is a non-configurable, non-writeable property meaning that it is best we don't try and mess with it too much, and the reason this blog entry exists if because I made the mistake of trying to outwit JavaScript.

## Context

I was working on a rather simple program that would console log a message depending on the hour. The function would take a string as an argument in the format of "HH:MM", 24-hour clock. My initial idea was to slice that string in order to take the first two characters, turn them into a Number and apply conditionals to return a message depending on the hour. 

```JavaScript
function greet(time) {
  let hour = Number(time.slice(0, 2));
  if (hour < 12 {
    return 'Good Morning';
  } else if (hour < 17) {
    return 'Good Afternoon';
  } else {
    return 'Good Evening';
  }
}
```
Pretty simple huh? So I thought...

At this point, I was getting the following return values:

```JavaScript
greet('8:40'); // 'Good Evening'
greet('14:21'); // 'Good Afternoon'
greet('19:00'); // 'Good Evening'
```

Hol' up. Something doesn't seem right. 

It just so happens that if the string passed into the greet function was a single digit hour, it would include the colon that separates the hours from minutes. Then try to convert `'8:'` to a Number, resulting in `NaN`.

## How I Tried to Outwit JavaScript and Miserably Failed

Well, this one is an easy fix... just gotta compare `hour` to `NaN` and enter the first condition/get the first return value, because hour will only be NaN if it's a morning hour... right? 

```JavaScript
function greet(time) {
  let hour = Number(time.slice(0, 2));
  if (hour < 12 || hour === NaN {
    return 'Good Morning';
  } else if (hour < 17) {
    return 'Good Afternoon';
  } else {
    return 'Good Evening';
  }
}
```

it makes sense, but the output values of this were the same as the ones previously. Why? turns out `NaN === NaN` returns `false`.

> But NaN IS NaN, what do you mean?!?!?!!?

Yeah, thought so too. The proper way to check if something is `NaN` is by using JavaScript's global function `isNaN()`.
